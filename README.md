A thermostat that signals whether the temperature is below a certain point. If the temperature falls below said point, an LED will light up. If the temperature raises past the set point, the light will turn off. Each time temperature is read from the sensor, the data is sent to a server in the cloud via Wi-Fi module integrated in the board. 

My strengths with these types of projects typically include understanding the requirements, visualizing the requirements, and data structures. I am typically good at creating data structures or complex sets of instructions to accomplish uncommon variations of a task. My method of creating code here involved two methods to solve the problem, I used a task scheduler with multiple enumerators but also implemented individual variables that are used to identify actions and states. 

A big area of improvement for me is organization and patience. When I write code, I usually try to finih the project in one sitting and this isn't very practical. I could also do much better at identifying and calclulating algorithm efficiency where not only speed is increased but memory is effectively saved. I could ultimately add more comments as well. 

The most transferable skill I learned is how to manipulate and initialize peripheral interfaces on microcontrollers. Other than that, I also learned how to implement state machines in a variety of ways. This is a very useful method of manipulating data continuously. Bit manipulation is also another skill that would be useful in a future embedded software position.
